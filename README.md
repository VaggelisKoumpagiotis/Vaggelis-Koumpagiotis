Greetings!
 My name is Vaggelis Koumpagiotis and I am a 17-year old high school student.

 I have been engaging with computer science for over 2 years now and during this period of my life I am learning how to use Python, which is my first programming language.

 My most noteworthy goal is to get into a Computers Science University so as to develop into a programmer.

 Another goal of mine, after I get into the university that I desire, is to learn by myself the C++ programming language by creating my own and first ever video game. I am confident that I will learn how to operate effortlessly C++.

 Lastly, programming is something that intrigues me a lot and I always try to find methods to acquire more and more knowledge and skills about it.
 Also, I am ironclad that this is what I want to engage with and as well that it is something that suits me.

 My sincere appreciation and gratitude for taking the time to have a look at my biography!
